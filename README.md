# D&D 5e Character Sheet Maker

A WIP character sheet maker for D&D 5e. Generates a [5e character sheet](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/character_sheets) PDF with fields filled out.

Live demo available [here](https://drogoganor.net/dnd/).

It's very limited in scope so far. Numerous features are not implemented.

I cannot guarantee all stat calculations are correct. You'll want to verify the numbers yourself. Your DM may be mad if you tell him you used this tool to create your character.

You'll need a D&D 5e [Player's Handbook](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook) to fill out instances of copyrighted text such as the personality traits, ideals, bonds and flaws.
